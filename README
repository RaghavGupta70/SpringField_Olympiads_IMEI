 The assignment is to make a GET API that can check if an IMEI is correct or not. 
 If it's correct, API should return it. If it's not correct, API should return a digit with which the given IMEI's last digit should be replaced to get a valid IMEI. 
 This will check that if the entered number is a valid 15 digit number or not and will display an error message on the interface.
